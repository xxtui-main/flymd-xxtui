## Core Features
- Editing Experience
  - Instant editing/WYSIWYG (powered by Milkdown)
  - Native low-latency: Preserves `<textarea>` pipeline, IME composition-friendly, smart bracket/quote pairing without disrupting input (Edit mode)
  - Unified indent & multi-line operations: `Tab` behaves consistently in Edit/WYSIWYG modes
  - Common formatting: `Ctrl+B` bold, `Ctrl+I` italic, `Ctrl+K` insert link; precise line/column/cursor feedback
  - WYSIWYG mode: Use `Ctrl+Enter` to exit code blocks
  **Edit mode uses standard syntax, double space + Enter triggers line break. Non-standard syntax will break line breaks in WYSIWYG mode. Reading mode unaffected**
  **Auto-completion only works in Edit mode**
  **Due to Chinese/English punctuation differences, Chinese IME may affect completion experience, recommend switching to English punctuation**
- Reading & Outline
  - Safe preview: `markdown-it` rendering + `highlight.js` code highlighting + `DOMPurify` HTML sanitization, external links auto-add `target="_blank"` + `rel="noopener"`
  - Outline navigation: Extract Markdown `H1–H6` to generate clickable TOC, highlight current heading, preview and scroll sync
  - PDF Bookmarks (Outline): Built-in PDF reading and bookmark outline, cached per file and auto-invalidated on changes
- iframe Embedding Support
  - Flexible embedding: Embed iframe controls in Markdown to include videos, maps, online documents, and other external web content
  - Simple syntax: Use HTML `<iframe>` tags directly with customizable width, height, and other attributes
  - Usage examples:
    ```html
    <!-- Embed YouTube video -->
    <iframe width="560" height="315"
      src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID"
      frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>

    <!-- Embed online document -->
    <iframe width="100%" height="500"
      src="https://example.com/document"
      frameborder="0">
    </iframe>

    <!-- Embed map -->
    <iframe width="600" height="450"
      src="https://www.openstreetmap.org/export/embed.html"
      frameborder="0">
    </iframe>
    ```
- Images & Hosting
  - One-step process: Paste/drag images auto-handled; prefer upload to S3/R2 and insert public URL; fallback to local save when unconfigured/failed
  - Local images just work: No extra configuration needed for preview
- Sync (WebDAV Extension)
  - Visual sync: Status hints, process logs, progress feedback, and conflict prompts
  - Remote MOVE optimization: Use `MOVE` to reduce duplicate download/upload, optimize rename/move scenarios
- Language & Usability
  - Bilingual (Chinese/English) + Auto: Follow system language or manual switch, remembers user choice
  - Position memory: Each file independently remembers last "reading/editing cursor/scroll position"
- Security & Performance
  - Local-first, zero background network: No network access unless explicitly enabled (image hosting, sync, etc.)
  - Performance optimization: Cold start and render pipeline with lazy loading, chunked static assets, controllable logs; target cold start <300ms, preview toggle <16ms (typical 2–3k line documents)
