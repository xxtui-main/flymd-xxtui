- Improved: Persist extension panel filters (Market: “Installed only”; Installed section: “Updates only”)

## Update v0.8.4
- Fixed: In Excel/Sheets formulas, absolute refs like `$A$1` / `C$2` / `$U:$U` no longer falsely trigger Markdown inline math (KaTeX)

## Update v0.8.3
- New: New tab name incremental naming

## Update v0.8.2
- Added: Tabs can be reordered via drag & drop
- Fixed: Deleting a document now destroys its corresponding tab to avoid stale tabs
- Fixed: Adjusted library sidebar auto-refresh timing to avoid potential UI blocking on Linux
- Improved: Built-in “AI Assistant” upgraded to v0.3.8: default truncation increased to 128K characters
- Fixed: Built-in “Floating Rich Text Toolbar” upgraded to v0.1.6: in WYSIWYG mode, after inserting a link the caret can exit the link node correctly

## Update v0.8.1
- Added: Resizable split view (drag to adjust the ratio)
- Added: WYSIWYG supports HTML rendering; optional HTML editing can be enabled in Theme settings (off by default) and will be converted back to Markdown
- Improved: Built-in flymd-RAG upgraded to v0.1.3: adds file fingerprinting, incrementally re-embeds modified documents and cleans up stale chunk references; index sync temporarily disabled (risk > benefit)

- Improved: Built-in “AI Assistant” chat now supports KaTeX formulas and uses a wider content layout
- Fixed: “Save as PDF” could be truncated and lose styles; export now preserves layout/styles

## Update v0.7.9
- Fixed: When the OS is in dark mode but the user explicitly turns off Night Mode , the UI could still render with dark-theme artifacts

## Update v0.7.8
- Fixed: WebDAV sync scanning no longer skips required hidden paths; `.flymd/library-id.json` and extension-registered extra prefixes (e.g. flymd-RAG `.flymd/rag-index/<libraryId>`) can now be uploaded/synced correctly.
- Improved: Built-in flymd-RAG upgraded to v0.1.1; toggling “Cloud Sync” in settings now refreshes WebDAV extra sync paths immediately to avoid stale index sync state.
- Fixed: In the extension marketplace, third-party homepage links may fail to open for certain URL formats; URLs are now normalized .
- Improved: Extension marketplace dialog layout and scroll area styling (wider/taller/denser spacing).
- Improved: Built-in AI Assistant upgraded to v0.3.4; adds a new “Explain” quick action, and Continue/Polish/Correct now prefer selected text when available; marketplace copy renamed to “AI Assistant”.

## Update v0.7.6
- Added: The Extensions panel now shows plugin provenance (Official / Third-party) and a safety notice for third-party extensions.
- Added: Published a third-party extension “EasyImage2.0 Uploader”, which can upload images to a custom Web API by configuring URL, field names, and JsonPath.
- Changed: Knowledge-base index storage is now fixed under the library root at `.flymd/rag-index/<libraryId>`, and a stable library ID is stored in `.flymd/library-id.json` for cross-device consistency; custom index directories are no longer supported (if you previously used a custom index directory, you may need to rebuild the index or migrate it manually).
- Improved: The plugin host exposes a WebDAV plugin API so extensions can register extra sync paths and subscribe to sync-complete events, enabling cross-device sync for index/cache data.
- Fixed: AI Assistant chat rendering incorrectly parsed unordered lists in some cases, which could drop list content.
- Improved: Renamed the built-in image hosting settings entry from “Image Host” to “Image Host (S3/R2)” for clarity.

## Update v0.7.5
- Added: Published the official “flymd-RAG Knowledge Index” extension, which builds vector indexes for local Markdown/TXT libraries, enabling semantic search over your vault and serving as the backbone for RAG-style knowledge conversations.
- Added: AI Assistant can optionally integrate with flymd-RAG and, before sending a request, run semantic search and append cited snippets from your vault so answers can combine “current chat + local knowledge”; when flymd-RAG is not installed or disabled, existing behavior remains unchanged.
- Added: Extended the plugin runtime with library-wide file listing, directory watching and per-library plugin data directories, giving knowledge-indexing extensions a more robust foundation and making it easier for other plugins to build lightweight indexes.
- Improved: flymd-RAG Knowledge Index now supports incremental indexing and better recall strategies, only reindexing changed files and significantly reducing wait times on large libraries.
- Improved: flymd-RAG adds advanced options such as custom index directory and per-document index rebuild, along with richer progress and error reporting to help diagnose indexing issues.
- Improved: Completed English UI and copy for both flymd-RAG and the AI Assistant integration so knowledge-base search works seamlessly in English environments.
- Added: AI Assistant now includes a built-in free vector/LLM mode that can power flymd-RAG indexing without requiring your own API key (within the free quota limits).

## Update v0.7.4
- Added: Published the “Property View” extension, which shows document metadata fields in a column-based sidebar table so you can browse and filter your library by properties as a foundation for attribute-driven knowledge management.
- Added: Published the “Notes & Tasks Calendar” extension that aggregates todos and notes by day on a calendar view, letting you scan and jump to tasks directly from the calendar.
- Added: Published the “Knowledge Whiteboard” extension with a dedicated canvas for nodes and edges that can link back to existing notes, helping you lay out knowledge structures visually.
- Improved: The AutoYAML Metadata extension now works together with the Property View, auto-filling front matter so that properties appear directly in the property table and are easier to maintain.
- Improved: Completed English dictionaries and in-app copy for extensions such as the high-precision PDF parser, MinerU parser and Smart Floating Toolbar, so users in English locale get full prompts and descriptions.
- Improved: Extended the i18n runtime with a `flymd:localeChanged` event so plugins can listen for language changes and re-register themselves or refresh UI copy to keep Chinese/English views in sync.
- Improved: After switching the app language, flyMD now shows a “please restart” suggestion to avoid display glitches caused by stale language state in some extensions or windows.

## Update v0.7.3
- Added: New “Extension Menu Manager” dialog under the “Plugins” menu that lists all context-menu entries and “Plugins” dropdown actions registered by extensions, letting you toggle visibility per extension to declutter the UI without uninstalling plugins.
- Added: Published the “AutoYAML Metadata” extension, which can automatically add YAML front matter to the current document (such as title and tags) and optionally call the AI assistant to generate tags and a summary, making it easier to maintain a more structured knowledge base.
- Improved: The Backlinks plugin now scans the YAML front matter at the top of each document for a `tags` field and folds those tags into its index and “related notes” logic, giving tag-driven vaults more accurate backlinks and recommendations.
- Improved: Completed English copy for the extensions marketplace and most official plugins (including Graph View, Backlinks, Git History, Word/Excel Importer, S3 Gallery, Typecho integrations, xxtui todo-push and AutoYAML Metadata), with manifests and plugin UIs now following flyMD’s language setting.
- Fixed: WebDAV sync status indicators no longer get stuck after enabling or disabling the built-in sync extension; switches in the extensions panel and related menus now reflect the current state immediately.

## Update v0.7.2
- Added: Official “Graph View” extension that builds a local relationship graph around the current note using the Backlinks index, rendered in a floating panel with clickable nodes and quick entries from the Plugins menu and editor context menu.
- Added: New “Smart Floating Toolbar” extension that pops up a draggable rich-text toolbar near the selection when you select text, with configurable heading hotkeys (Ctrl+1–6 by default) and quick actions for links, images and formatting.
- Improved: The floating toolbar can now be configured to “only show when there is a selection”, correctly distinguishes source / WYSIWYG / reading modes (and stays hidden in reading mode), adds a one-click “reset heading hotkeys” option, and uses new host APIs such as `getSourceCaretRect` / `onSelectionChange` so the toolbar can follow the caret precisely in source mode.
- Improved: The extensions marketplace is now prewarmed in the background when the app goes idle (overlay construction + first full render + market index fetch into the store cache), and category filters operate purely on the locally cached list; combined with cached installed/update state this makes the marketplace open almost instantly without extra network round-trips.
- Improved: Built-in entries for WebDAV sync and the S3/R2 uploader have been added to the main “Plugins” menu, making it easier to find and manage sync/image-bed settings from a single place.
- Improved: When you rename or move a file from the library sidebar, any open tabs tracking that file now update their paths and titles accordingly; closing tabs or exiting the app after edits now honours whether the save operation actually cleared the dirty state, so cancelling a “Save As” dialog or hitting a save failure no longer leads to accidental exits.

## Update v0.7.1
- Added: New “PicList Uploader” extension that lets you select local image paths or Markdown image syntax in source mode, upload them to a local PicList HTTP server with one click, and replace the selection with the hosted URL; an optional “auto upload after paste” switch can watch pasted `pasted-*` images and automatically upload + rewrite them.
- Added: PicList uploader is now integrated with WYSIWYG mode via paste/flush hooks so that the same auto-upload pipeline applies while editing visually, keeping behaviour consistent across modes.
- Added: Built-in “S3 Gallery” extension that aggregates images uploaded via the built-in S3/R2 uploader into a visual gallery, with thumbnail previews and actions to copy links, insert into the current note, or delete remote objects for easier image housekeeping.
- Added: Extension marketplace now supports category filters; together with the new “PicList Uploader”, “S3 Gallery” and “Flyshow Publish” extensions you can quickly discover storage/publishing tools under dedicated categories.
- Added: The plugin host now exposes new filesystem APIs (`readTextFile`, `writeTextFile`, `listLibraryFiles`) so extensions can safely read/write files inside the current library and enumerate Markdown documents, enabling richer plugin scenarios.
- Improved: The S3 uploader now persists upload history and exposes list APIs that can be reused by management-oriented extensions such as “S3 Gallery”, laying the groundwork for more advanced image-bed management features.
## Update v0.7.0
- Added: The Word/Excel Importer now extracts `data:`-URL images from the converted HTML, saves them as standalone files under an `images/` subfolder next to the current document, and inserts relative paths in the generated Markdown; the plugin runtime also exposes a new `saveBinaryToCurrentFolder` API so extensions can safely write binaries beside the current file and get back a path suitable for Markdown.
- Improved: In WYSIWYG mode, pasting images into an unsaved document no longer inlines them as base64 inside the text; instead they fall back to being stored in the system Pictures directory (matching source-mode behaviour), which keeps documents smaller and reduces memory spikes while editing.
- Added: The Backlinks plugin now decorates `[[name]]` text in the reading preview as clickable links that jump directly to the target note, with more robust parsing for patterns such as `[[Title]]`, `[[Title|Alias]]` and even WYSIWYG-escaped `\\[\\[...\\]\\]`.
- Improved: The Backlinks side panel is now closed by default and can be toggled from a unified “Show/Hide backlinks panel” entry in the editor/preview/WYSIWYG context menus, while fixes around preview-root handling make occasional broken link clicks far less likely.
- Fixed: On setups with multiple monitors or corrupted window state, the main window could grow beyond the virtual desktop or restore to absurd sizes; window sizing is now clamped against a Rust-side “virtual screen size” calculation while still enforcing a minimum of 960×640.
- Fixed: On macOS, the auto-updater now matches assets by preferring `.dmg` / `.pkg` / `.app.zip` and recognising “universal” builds, avoiding accidentally picking up Windows portable ZIPs and leading to more reliable in-app updates.

## Update v0.6.9
- Added: New “Backlinks” plugin built on `[[Title]]` wiki-style syntax that automatically builds forward and backward links between notes and exposes a side panel to inspect which notes reference the current document, with a one-click “rebuild index” action.
- Added: Backlinks panel now integrates AI-powered semantic related-note suggestions; under the current document you can see AI-picked related notes, left-click to open the note, or right-click to insert a `[[link]]` to it at the cursor.
- Added: New editor context-menu entries such as “Insert backlink” and “Refresh backlinks for current note”, making it easier to wrap selected text with `[[Title]]` links; when used together with the AI assistant plugin you can insert AI-recommended related notes with a single action.
- Improved: Source mode now has inline `[[title]]` completion; when you type `[[` in the plain Markdown editor, a suggestion box pops up listing notes from the current library and you can pick one with arrow keys + Enter (note: title completion for backlinks is currently only available in source mode; WYSIWYG mode automatically disables this feature).
- Improved: The “PDF & Image High-Precision Parser” extension now downloads remote images to local storage and reads them via the plugin runtime, reducing the chance of broken images when CDN links expire.
- Fixed: On macOS, double-clicking document icons or opening files/libraries from Finder on a cold start could fail to deliver the path to flyMD; path handling has been hardened so these entry points behave more reliably.
- Fixed: In some multi-monitor setups with certain resolution/DPI combinations, the main window could grow abnormally large or beyond screen bounds; window sizing has been adjusted to stay within a reasonable range.
- Misc: WYSIWYG v2 now handles bracket escaping and image paths more carefully so Obsidian-style `[[links]]` survive mode switches as much as possible, and several internal implementation details have been cleaned up.

## Update v0.6.8
- Added: A “Paste as plain text” entry in the context menu so you can insert stripped text in any mode without bringing over messy styles from web pages or rich-text editors.
- Improved: The source-mode paste conversion pipeline for HTML → Markdown, reducing extra blank lines, broken lists and other formatting glitches so pasted content stays closer to the original semantics.
- Added: Published the “Word/Excel Importer” extension that parses common Office documents and imports them as Markdown into your current library, making it easier to consolidate scattered materials.
- Improved: Moved the “Config backup” and “Portable mode” switches into the File menu, simplifying the context menu and keeping frequent actions under a clearer entry point.
- Fixed: A portable-mode issue that could lead to the document library path being lost or unintentionally cleared, improving safety when running from USB drives or portable bundles.

## Update v0.6.7
- Added: Markdown footnote syntax support (`[^1]` / `[^name]`) so both source and reading modes render proper footnote sections, keeping annotations structured in long documents.
- Improved: Footnote markers in reading mode now show a tooltip with the full footnote content near the reference, reducing scroll back-and-forth when looking up notes.
- Added: Published the “Git Version Control” extension, bringing a VS Code–style Git sidebar to flyMD with history list and inline diff highlighting for the current library and the current document.
- Added: Extended the runtime with Git command bridge APIs that only allow safe operations such as status inspection, history querying and explicit commits, avoiding destructive actions on existing repositories.
- Misc: Polished error handling and safety checks around Git-related features to lay groundwork for future version-control-centric extensions.

## Update v0.6.6
- Added: Source mode now supports a “Source + Reading” split view with editor on the left and live preview on the right, keeping scroll positions in sync and making large-screen writing more comfortable.
- Improved: Split view is hardened with window-width guard rails, auto-exit when switching modes or files, and debounced preview refresh to keep the layout stable on narrow windows.
- Added: File deletion in the library sidebar now uses an in-app JS confirmation dialog instead of the native system dialog, providing clearer copy, consistent styling and reducing the risk of accidental deletes.
- Added: WYSIWYG mode now understands `<!-- ... -->` HTML comment nodes so comment blocks in Markdown are preserved instead of being silently dropped during rendering.
- Added: New “Upload to image host (S3/R2)” entry in the image context menu that reads the underlying local file, uploads it to object storage and copies the generated Markdown link to the clipboard without touching current document content.
- Added: Autosave capability on desktop environments that can write files, periodically saving the current document in the background and persisting the toggle state to reduce data loss on unexpected exits.
- Fixed: Undo right after pasting text in source mode could clear the entire document; undo now only reverts the latest paste operation.
- Misc: Small tweaks to the PDF-to-Word plugin and related details to improve stability and compatibility.

## Update v0.6.4
- Added: Extension runtime now exposes `context.getLibraryRoot` and `context.saveMarkdownToCurrentFolder`, so plugins can safely read/write Markdown files inside the current library, enabling richer local automation flows such as PDF parsing and translation.
- Improved: The “PDF & Image High-Precision Parser” extension now supports automatic paginated translation for large PDFs and shows a confirmation dialog before starting long-running translation tasks, reducing accidental heavy jobs and quota waste.
- Improved: The document library now watches the filesystem and refreshes automatically when third-party tools create, delete or modify files under the library root, keeping the sidebar in sync with the actual folder contents.
- Improved: Library sidebar context menu positions itself within the visible window to avoid being clipped off-screen, and the `D` / `M` keyboard shortcuts have been removed to eliminate rare accidental triggers.
- Improved: When creating a new document or folder from the library sidebar, flyMD now prompts for a name first and only then creates the underlying file or directory, avoiding piles of “untitled” entries.
- Fixed: Reverted the dark-mode behavior change introduced in v0.6.3 and temporarily restored the “auto-enable dark theme when the OS is in dark mode” logic to fix dark-theme issues on some platforms.
- Docs: Updated README and plugin development docs to cover the new extension APIs and the latest usage notes for the MinerU PDF/Image parsing extension.

## Update v0.6.3
- Added: Published the official “MinerU PDF/Image Parser” extension, which uses the MinerU API to structurally parse PDFs and images, providing an alternative pipeline for complex scans and mixed image+text documents.
- Added: Published the “Send to Blinko” extension, adding a context-menu entry to send the current content to Blinko in one click.
- Improved: Upgraded the “PDF & Image High-Precision Parser” extension to support direct image parsing and one-click PDF translation, making it more effective on handwritten, complex-layout and multi-language documents.
- Improved: Updated the AI assistant extension and its model list, removing support for the Qwen3-Omni model.
- Improved: Removed the logic that force-enables dark theme when the OS is in dark mode; theme light/dark now strictly follows flyMD’s own setting so users have full control regardless of system appearance.
- Improved: Library sidebar now forcibly disables background grid patterns and always uses a solid background, keeping document lists readable under all themes.
- Fixed: Incorrect title extraction in WYSIWYG mode that could cause the window title to diverge from the actual document title.
- Fixed: The xxtui todo-push extension now preserves the original Markdown text when sending tasks and reminders instead of losing formatting.
- Refactored: Split the file library, todo mode, focus mode, sticky notes, plugin host & settings panels, image-hosting configuration, context menus, update window and more into dedicated runtime/UI modules, consolidating core capabilities into reusable extension-style building blocks that reduce coupling and prepare for a richer extension ecosystem.

## Update v0.6.2
- Added: Published the official “PDF High-Precision Parser” extension powered by large models, which converts PDFs into Markdown or docx with better layout preservation and support for handwriting, formulas and tables, including one-click “To MD / To Docx” actions for the currently opened PDF.
- Added: Extension runtime now exposes `getCurrentFilePath` and `readFileBinary` APIs so plugins can read the current document as raw bytes by absolute path, enabling scenarios such as PDF parsing and image processing.
- Improved: Sticky Note mode windows now hide their taskbar icons on desktop platforms, making them feel more like native sticky notes and freeing up taskbar space.
- Fixed: When “Default WYSIWYG mode” was enabled, opening a PDF by double-clicking could force WYSIWYG mode and break PDF preview; the dedicated PDF viewer is now preserved and WYSIWYG auto-switch is skipped in this case.
- Improved: Updated README and project configuration to reflect the new extension and related workflows.

## Update v0.6.1
- Improved: In WYSIWYG mode, unordered lists now use `-` instead of `*`, keeping list markers consistent with source-mode Markdown and making copy/paste comparisons easier.
- Added: The xxtui todo-push extension now supports configurable write-back markers and a refactored settings panel navigation, so advanced workflows are easier to configure.
- Improved: The code block language selector in WYSIWYG now automatically hides once the caret leaves the code block, reducing visual noise while typing.
- Improved: Empty Mermaid blocks in WYSIWYG automatically enter edit mode, and symbol auto-completion is disabled inside code blocks to avoid fighting with normal coding habits.
- Improved: Mermaid diagrams show clearer error hints on failures and several WYSIWYG rendering edge cases are fixed, making diagrams more stable and diagnosable.
- Fixed: Multiple KaTeX editing issues, including the Delete key not working, formulas not activating on mouse click, double-click glitches and styling problems, so formula editing feels closer to plain text.
- Improved: Added several small helper hints and labels in the UI so new features are easier to discover and understand.

## Update v0.6.0
- Added: Custom typography controls in the Theme panel (line height, paragraph spacing, content max width and first-line indent), so you can tune the reading/WYSIWYG/source layouts to your own taste.
- Added: A “Default source mode” toggle; when enabled, flyMD always opens documents in source mode instead of auto-switching to preview.
- Added: In WYSIWYG mode, automatic pairing / wrapping / paired deletion for both Chinese and Western brackets & quotes, scoped to the ProseMirror view so it does not interfere with source-mode typing.
- Improved: Typing ``` and pressing Enter in WYSIWYG mode now instantly creates a framed code block with language selector, with better keyboard navigation and more robust handling of $$ math blocks.
- Improved: First-line indent now only applies to top-level paragraphs, no longer affecting Mermaid diagrams or code blocks; dedicated Mermaid styles in WYSIWYG avoid truncated Chinese labels and layout glitches.
- Improved: The bracket wrapping logic and caret positioning in WYSIWYG have gone through several refinement rounds, fixing issues like “caret only enters on the first line” and making the editor feel more like a word processor.
- Fixed: In 0.5.9, window control buttons could disappear when compact titlebar was disabled on some platforms; this has been corrected and an old Win32 style hack removed so titlebar behavior is more predictable.

## Update v0.5.9
- Added: Custom color theme controls plus a "parchment" style toggle, making it easier to tune contrast and create long-form reading themes.
- Improved: Custom colors can now apply globally across the app, and background color layers are simplified so the editor, sidebar and chrome feel more consistent in both light and dark themes; sidebar buttons, the plugin menu and compact title bar window controls are all aligned with the updated visual system.
- Improved: Removed the native Windows window border so compact title bar mode looks fully integrated with the rest of the UI on Windows.
- Improved: WebDAV sync now scans directories and transfers files with higher concurrency (up to 8 parallel tasks) and introduces retry with exponential backoff, making sync throughput and reliability more stable on shaky networks.
- Improved: Switching between Source / WYSIWYG / Reading modes now shows a small notification bubble for the current mode, and all "Edit mode" labels are renamed to "Source mode" to keep terminology consistent.
- Added: WYSIWYG mode now supports deleting code blocks directly, and nodes that support double-click editing (Mermaid, KaTeX, images) gain dedicated delete buttons for quick cleanup.
- Fixed: Issues with the KaTeX delete button in WYSIWYG mode and a bug where sidebar buttons did not follow global theme settings.

## Update v0.5.8
- Added: Global body font toggle that lets your custom text font apply to the entire UI (menus, buttons, plugin windows) and a shared monospace font variable used by the editor, preview and AI assistant so typography stays consistent across the app.
- Added: Custom font manager in the theme panel that lists installed fonts and lets you delete them, automatically cleaning up font files, injected styles and any theme preferences that reference removed fonts.
- Improved: Switching between Edit, WYSIWYG and Reading modes now keeps the viewport and scroll position aligned so the text under your cursor no longer jumps when you flip modes to compare formatting.
- Improved: Reading mode code blocks in dark mode now use consistent syntax highlighting and backgrounds with the editor, restoring contrast and readability at night.
- Improved: The extension marketplace now uses a stable sort order (built-in, recommended, then A–Z by name), adds an "Updatable" filter, and proactively invalidates cached metadata when sort rules or structure change so you always see fresh plugin lists.
- Improved: Sticky note mode now ignores global dark mode and refines its toolbar buttons, while the native context menu is disabled on notes to avoid accidental right-click actions on small note windows.
- Improved: Focus Mode and main menu buttons receive layout and spacing tweaks for clearer hierarchies and more predictable hit targets, aligning controls with the compact title bar design.
- Improved: AI assistant dark mode styling and the Vision toggle appearance are tuned to match flyMD’s night theme, with code snippets honoring the global monospace font setting.
- Fixed: Restored window dragging on Linux and macOS when compact title bar mode is enabled so you can still drag the window from inside flyMD even when the native title bar is hidden.

## Update v0.5.7
- Added: Compact title bar mode with custom window controls drawn inside flyMD, toggled from the theme panel and persisted between launches, including integration with Focus Mode so the native title bar can be fully hidden.
- Added: Syntax highlighting for code blocks in WYSIWYG mode plus a compact icon-style copy button that adapts to light/dark backgrounds for easier reading and copying of long code snippets.
- Added: Typecho Manager upgrades including editable title in the download/publish dialog, automatic title fallback from the current file name, a new API that renames the local Markdown file to `ID-title` after publish, and better compatibility with themes that rely on a top-level `thumb` field.
- Added: Third-party "Xiaohongshu copywriting generator" AI extension, now listed in the marketplace and acknowledged in the Chinese and English READMEs.
- Improved: Night mode backgrounds for edit, WYSIWYG, reading and surrounding chrome (sidebar/menu/tabbar) with a new derived color model that keeps chrome visually close to the content area and avoids overly bright or overly dark bars.
- Improved: Chrome colors for the title bar, menu bar, sidebar and tab bar now track the active mode (edit / WYSIWYG / reading) and theme, updating automatically when switching modes or changing theme preferences.
- Improved: Images in WYSIWYG mode can be double-clicked to edit their source URL; the original local path is preserved in a dedicated attribute so you no longer see or edit `base64` / `asset:` intermediate URLs.
- Improved: URL pasting behavior is now unified between edit and WYSIWYG modes — pressing `Ctrl+V` on a plain URL fetches the page `<title>` and inserts a link, powered by a shared `flymdFetchPageTitle` helper.
- Improved: The insert-link dialog now focuses and selects the URL field by default for quick paste-to-replace, and the "+" tab button is always rendered as the last item so tabs align more predictably.
- Fixed: Mermaid diagrams and code highlighting colors in dark mode to restore contrast and readability; WYSIWYG background color controls are disabled in dark mode to avoid unreadable combinations.
- Fixed: A case where Backspace on an empty input could bubble up and close the dialog; Backspace at the start of text inputs/textareas is now intercepted so focus safely remains in the field.

## Update v0.5.6
- Added: Official "Typecho Post Manager" extension that uses XML-RPC to fetch posts from Typecho, filter by date/category, and download them as local Markdown files, and it is now listed in the built-in extension marketplace.
- Added: Typecho Manager now supports creating and publishing posts directly from flyMD, editing slug/cover/custom fields, and lazily loading categories from the remote site on first publish to reduce manual configuration.
- Added: New `context.htmlToMarkdown` API for extensions, allowing plugins to convert HTML returned by Typecho, WordPress or arbitrary web APIs into Markdown with optional `baseUrl` to resolve relative links.
- Added: Built-in free Gemini Vision model in the AI Assistant so you can choose "Gemini Vision" under the free provider, with a dedicated "Bohe Gongyi" badge and link when that channel is used.
- Improved: Typecho Manager now supports keyword search, bulk download of selected posts, and smarter default download directories (relative or absolute), and automatically refreshes the file tree after pulling articles so your library view stays in sync with disk.
- Added: Advanced Typecho management tools including related-post suggestions based on the current document, per-blog statistics/health checks, and safe remote snapshots with rollback history so you can restore previous versions if a publish overwrites server content.
- Improved: Front Matter handling when downloading or publishing Typecho posts, preserving excerpt/cover/custom_* fields in YAML and writing them back after publish so local Markdown stays aligned with remote metadata.
- Added: Auto-hide scrollbars across editor, preview and library with hover-to-show behavior, plus a compact Front Matter summary bar at the top of Reading mode (title, categories, tags, status, slug/ID, date, source) with a toggle to show or hide it.
- Improved: Error handling for free models — when you hit rate limits or the daily free quota, the assistant now shows clear messages with the reason and suggested wait time instead of blindly retrying 429 responses.
- Improved: Applied a 1MB size limit to local images used in Vision mode and paste; oversized images are skipped with explicit warnings to avoid overloading requests, and fixed AI plugin docking so hidden windows no longer keep squeezing the editor area.
- Improved: Outline panel can be detached from the library into its own column, letting you switch between "Library | Outline | Editor" and "Library | Editor | Outline" layouts; when a plugin window docks on the right, the outline automatically shifts left, alongside visual polish to the library/sidebar, scrollbars, status bar and a Linux fix that forces an opaque background to avoid transparent/blank windows on Arch-like distributions.
- Fixed: Installed local fonts are now re-registered on launch so font selections like "Local: XXX" continue to work correctly after upgrading or restarting.

## Update v0.5.5
- Added: AI vision capabilities that let the assistant directly read local images and call vision models for understanding and analysis, including a time-limited free vision model to make it easier to try.
- Added: New window layout APIs for the extension system, enabling a three-column layout ("library sidebar + AI panel on the left + editor") and dynamic plugin positioning so right-docked and bottom-docked plugin panes avoid overlapping each other.
- Added: Exposed a YAML Front Matter and parsed metadata API so plugins can read the document front matter in a unified way, useful for blog publishing, library enhancements, and external app sync.
- Added: Published the third-party "Telegraph-Image" image hosting plugin in the extension marketplace so you can upload images to Telegraph in one click and get back shareable links.
- Improved: Layout behavior of AI plugin windows and bottom plugin panes in WYSIWYG mode so they no longer cover the tab bar and correctly push the editor area instead of overlapping it.
- Improved: Error handling around local and hosted images with size/limit prompts and fallback strategies, and fixed cases where images in dialogs or source mode could not be recognized by the AI.
- Fixed: Library sidebar drag-and-drop sorting now persists correctly, and several CORS-related issues and other edge cases have been resolved for a more stable overall experience.

## Update v0.5.4
- Added: AI chat can now link with Sticky Notes so you can quickly turn replies into notes or todos and keep ideas from getting lost.
- Improved: Default Sticky Note spawn position so new notes appear closer to the current document and area of focus, reducing manual dragging.
- Added: Custom drag-and-drop ordering for the sidebar tree so you can arrange documents in whatever order best matches your workflow.
- Improved: PDFs are now sorted separately from Markdown files in the library while still honoring your custom sort order, and deprecated custom library icons have been removed.
- Improved: PDF items are now distinguished by text color instead of a red dot, making the file list cleaner and less visually noisy.
- Improved: WebDAV sync defaults — newly created libraries start with WebDAV sync disabled to avoid accidentally syncing into an old library; once a sync path is configured, the setting follows library switching.
- Fixed: Added an explicit prompt when WebDAV is not configured and fixed a bug where the sync conflict dialog might fail to appear, reducing the risk of silent conflicts.
- Docs: Updated README and corrected the PackyCode link formatting.

## Update v0.5.3
- Added: Extension marketplace search for extension name, author, and description, plus GitHub / Official channel switching, an "installed only" filter, and a "Featured" badge with clearer card layout and loading states.
- Added: "Markdown Table Helper" marketplace extension that lets you quickly insert Markdown tables at the cursor, working together with WYSIWYG mode for a more spreadsheet-like editing experience.
- Improved: Unified table styling across Edit / Reading / WYSIWYG modes with light/dark-aware table color variables for borders and headers, boosting contrast and readability on dark backgrounds.
- Improved: Theme settings panel with new typography presets ("Tech", "Literary"), a new "Minimalist" Markdown style, and additional eye-friendly palettes (Tea Green, Paper White, Soft Pink), plus a tighter overall layout.
- Improved: Extension manager now uses incremental updates and background refresh of marketplace data when reopening the panel, avoiding full re-renders while still allowing a manual "Refresh" to force updates.
- Fixed: Visual inconsistencies in table borders/header colors under dark mode and some themes, and several styling issues in the extension manager when using dark themes.

## Update v0.5.2
- Added: Switched collaboration mode to a JS-driven custom cursor with clearer color differentiation, aligned cursor colors in the collaboration plugin, and bundled an official collaboration server option to make multi-user sessions easier to recognize and join.
- Improved: Refined WYSIWYG editing styles for KaTeX and other inline math, together with a cleaner baseline layout for the plain Edit mode so long-form editing and reading feel more consistent.
- Fixed: A series of WYSIWYG issues where Mermaid/Math NodeViews were constantly rebuilt (causing scrolling glitches), duplicate scrollbars appeared, and the code-block copy button stopped working, greatly improving stability.
- Fixed: Missing syntax highlighting for code blocks in WYSIWYG, blank Mermaid diagrams, and failures when opening PDFs from that mode, covering several rendering/export edge cases.
- Improved: Sticky Note mode styling and layout, including automatic height adjustment based on content, and fixed layout glitches that could appear when launching sticky notes from WYSIWYG mode.
- Added: New "Generate tag" and "Open in new instance" entries to the sidebar tree context menu to speed up multi-library and multi-window workflows.
- Fixed: Reading mode sometimes falling back to a pure white background under certain themes, and introduced a compatibility tweak for Arch Linux AppImage builds affected by WebKitGTK / GPU driver interactions that could cause white-screen issues.

## Update v0.5.1
- Added: Open collaborative editing support with an open-source FlyMD collaboration server sample (the `OSserver` directory) and the companion "Collaboration (Open Server)" extension, enabling room + password based multi-user editing on your own server (Beta).
- Added: Plugin host APIs for registering/consuming custom namespaces and listening to source-editor selection changes, providing the foundation for collaboration and other advanced extensions.
- Improved: File-tree click/double-click integration with the multi-tab system to avoid tab mix-ups or overwritten content when using Ctrl+click or switching libraries.
- Improved: Editor layout sizing and scrolling logic, fixing cases where repeated Enter presses could push the menubar/tabbar off-screen and where edit/preview area heights were miscalculated.
- Fixed: Layout glitches where using `Ctrl+Shift+V` to paste long "plain text" could make the menubar/tabbar disappear or become inconsistent.

## Update v0.5.0
- Added: Sticky Note mode to open the current document in a compact, dedicated note window that automatically switches to Focus + Reading mode, hides the sidebar, and keeps only the content area—ideal for todos, small reference notes, and ideas that should stay on the desktop.
- Added: Sticky Note controls with round "Lock position" and "Always on top" buttons, so you can disable window dragging to avoid accidental moves and keep notes floating above other apps.
- Added: Enhanced tab right-click menu with "Open in new instance", direct file rename on disk, and one-click "Create sticky note" from the current tab.
- Added: Sticky Note mode now supports quick todo input—type a line, press Enter or blur the field to jump back to Reading mode, and completed items get automatic strikethrough so notes work better as a lightweight todo board.
- Added: Integrated "Push" and "Remind" buttons into Sticky Note headers to send notes directly into the xxtui todo list and schedule reminders; new host APIs for the xxtui todo-push plugin and AI Assistant enable right-click actions "Generate todo" and "Generate & create reminder" that turn selected text into structured tasks.
- Improved: AI Assistant replies now support Markdown rendering and code highlighting, making long answers and code snippets much easier to read.
- Improved: AI requests gain automatic retry with a clearer "thinking…" indicator, while long-running operations like translation use a persistent, dismissible notification bar instead of transient toasts.
- Improved: Reworked the editor undo/redo logic with per-tab undo stacks so switching tabs or WYSIWYG modes no longer corrupts or mixes up your undo history.
- Fixed: Some extensions' long-running notifications either failed to stay visible or could not be dismissed correctly when using the unified notification API, and several scrolling/offset glitches in WYSIWYG mode plus code-copy button positioning in long documents.

## Update v0.4.8
- Added: WebDAV sync now supports end-to-end encryption, encrypting file contents locally before upload so even compromised servers cannot easily read the plaintext.
- Added: Restored the OMG preset endpoint and signup link in the AI Assistant settings for quick access to the OMG resource bundle.
- Added: More theme background options and Markdown layout presets, together with a refreshed layout for the theme settings panel.
- Fixed: WYSIWYG bold/italic shortcuts sometimes leaving the caret in the wrong position.
- Fixed: WYSIWYG code-block copy button becoming misaligned when used inside long code blocks.
- Fixed: Tauri HTTP scope validation so legitimate HTTP/HTTPS requests are no longer blocked by overly strict rules.

## Update v0.4.7
- Added: Full configuration export/import so you can back up or migrate all FlyMD settings, extensions, and cache data in one shot.
- Added: Portable Mode to store config alongside the app root, making it easy to carry FlyMD on a USB drive.
- Added: Tab right-click menu so actions like closing or pinning a tab can be done directly on the tab bar (details will be iterated in later builds).
- Improved: Adjusted `Ctrl+N` behavior to better fit the multi-tab workflow so new files and new tabs behave more intuitively together.
- Improved: When all tabs are closed, FlyMD now returns to a blank document in edit mode instead of leaving you in a “no document” state.
- Improved: Unified the plugin notification system through a top notification center and exposed new `showNotification / hideNotification` APIs for extensions.

- Improved: On launch the app reads the OS dark preference, automatically forces night mode when appropriate, and ships refreshed tab-bar polish for dark themes.
- Improved: The extension runtime exposes a static asset URL helper, letting the AI assistant bundle avatar/fallback resources so icons render even offline.
- Fixed: Switching tabs no longer falsely marks documents as dirty, so confirmation dialogs only appear when real edits exist.

## Update v0.4.5
- Added: WebDAV sync now exposes a HTTP host whitelist so plaintext sync only runs against explicitly trusted hosts/ports, blocking accidental connections to unknown nodes.
- Improved: The sync dialog gains inline whitelist rows with + / - controls and empty-state hints, always keeping at least one editable input for smoother configuration.
- Improved: WYSIWYG edits now trigger the outline refresh pipeline and code-copy buttons always emit Markdown fences with language info for cleaner paste results.
- Fixed: Reworked the WYSIWYG `Ctrl+B / Ctrl+I` shortcuts to wrap selections directly in the Markdown source so the commands keep working even after focus hiccups.
- Improved: Save operations broadcast to the tab system, which instantly refreshes tab paths and clears the dirty asterisk after Save / Save As flows.
- Improved: Tauri request security is refactored to isolate the default HTTP scope into a dedicated `http:allow-fetch` role, limiting network access to declared URLs.
