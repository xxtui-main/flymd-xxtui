# Roadmap

[简体中文](ROADMAP.md) | [English](ROADMAP.en.md)

## Update v0.6.0
- Added: Custom typography controls in the Theme panel (line height, paragraph spacing, content max width and first-line indent), so you can tune the reading/WYSIWYG/source layouts to your own taste.
- Added: A “Default source mode” toggle; when enabled, flyMD always opens documents in source mode instead of auto-switching to preview.
- Added: In WYSIWYG mode, automatic pairing / wrapping / paired deletion for both Chinese and Western brackets & quotes, scoped to the ProseMirror view so it does not interfere with source-mode typing.
- Improved: Typing ``` and pressing Enter in WYSIWYG mode now instantly creates a framed code block with language selector, with better keyboard navigation and more robust handling of $$ math blocks.
- Improved: First-line indent now only applies to top-level paragraphs, no longer affecting Mermaid diagrams or code blocks; dedicated Mermaid styles in WYSIWYG avoid truncated Chinese labels and layout glitches.
- Improved: The bracket wrapping logic and caret positioning in WYSIWYG have gone through several refinement rounds, fixing issues like “caret only enters on the first line” and making the editor feel more like a word processor.
- Fixed: In 0.5.9, window control buttons could disappear when compact titlebar was disabled on some platforms; this has been corrected and an old Win32 style hack removed so titlebar behavior is more predictable.

## Update v0.5.9
- Added: Custom color theme controls plus a "parchment" style toggle, making it easier to tune contrast and create long-form reading themes.
- Improved: Custom colors can now apply globally across the app, and background color layers are simplified so the editor, sidebar and chrome feel more consistent in both light and dark themes; sidebar buttons, the plugin menu and compact title bar window controls are all aligned with the updated visual system.
- Improved: Removed the native Windows window border so compact title bar mode looks fully integrated with the rest of the UI on Windows.
- Improved: WebDAV sync now scans directories and transfers files with higher concurrency (up to 8 parallel tasks) and introduces retry with exponential backoff, making sync throughput and reliability more stable on shaky networks.
- Improved: Switching between Source / WYSIWYG / Reading modes now shows a small notification bubble for the current mode, and all "Edit mode" labels are renamed to "Source mode" to keep terminology consistent.
- Added: WYSIWYG mode now supports deleting code blocks directly, and nodes that support double-click editing (Mermaid, KaTeX, images) gain dedicated delete buttons for quick cleanup.
- Fixed: Issues with the KaTeX delete button in WYSIWYG mode and a bug where sidebar buttons did not follow global theme settings.

## Update v0.5.8
- Added: Global body font toggle that lets your custom text font apply to the entire UI (menus, buttons, plugin windows) and a shared monospace font variable used by the editor, preview and AI assistant so typography stays consistent across the app.
- Added: Custom font manager in the theme panel that lists installed fonts and lets you delete them, automatically cleaning up font files, injected styles and any theme preferences that reference removed fonts.
- Improved: Switching between Edit, WYSIWYG and Reading modes now keeps the viewport and scroll position aligned so the text under your cursor no longer jumps when you flip modes to compare formatting.
- Improved: Reading mode code blocks in dark mode now use consistent syntax highlighting and backgrounds with the editor, restoring contrast and readability at night.
- Improved: The extension marketplace now uses a stable sort order (built-in, recommended, then A–Z by name), adds an "Updatable" filter, and proactively invalidates cached metadata when sort rules or structure change so you always see fresh plugin lists.
- Improved: Sticky note mode now ignores global dark mode and refines its toolbar buttons, while the native context menu is disabled on notes to avoid accidental right-click actions on small note windows.
- Improved: Focus Mode and main menu buttons receive layout and spacing tweaks for clearer hierarchies and more predictable hit targets, aligning controls with the compact title bar design.
- Improved: AI assistant dark mode styling and the Vision toggle appearance are tuned to match flyMD’s night theme, with code snippets honoring the global monospace font setting.
- Fixed: Restored window dragging on Linux and macOS when compact title bar mode is enabled so you can still drag the window from inside flyMD even when the native title bar is hidden.

## Update v0.5.7
- Added: Compact title bar mode with custom window controls drawn inside flyMD, toggled from the theme panel and persisted between launches, including integration with Focus Mode so the native title bar can be fully hidden.
- Added: Syntax highlighting for code blocks in WYSIWYG mode plus a compact icon-style copy button that adapts to light/dark backgrounds for easier reading and copying of long code snippets.
- Added: Typecho Manager upgrades including editable title in the download/publish dialog, automatic title fallback from the current file name, a new API that renames the local Markdown file to `ID-title` after publish, and better compatibility with themes that rely on a top-level `thumb` field.
- Added: Third-party "Xiaohongshu copywriting generator" AI extension, now listed in the marketplace and acknowledged in the Chinese and English READMEs.
- Improved: Night mode backgrounds for edit, WYSIWYG, reading and surrounding chrome (sidebar/menu/tabbar) with a new derived color model that keeps chrome visually close to the content area and avoids overly bright or overly dark bars.
- Improved: Chrome colors for the title bar, menu bar, sidebar and tab bar now track the active mode (edit / WYSIWYG / reading) and theme, updating automatically when switching modes or changing theme preferences.
- Improved: Images in WYSIWYG mode can be double-clicked to edit their source URL; the original local path is preserved in a dedicated attribute so you no longer see or edit `base64` / `asset:` intermediate URLs.
- Improved: URL pasting behavior is now unified between edit and WYSIWYG modes — pressing `Ctrl+V` on a plain URL fetches the page `<title>` and inserts a link, powered by a shared `flymdFetchPageTitle` helper.
- Improved: The insert-link dialog now focuses and selects the URL field by default for quick paste-to-replace, and the "+" tab button is always rendered as the last item so tabs align more predictably.
- Fixed: Mermaid diagrams and code highlighting colors in dark mode to restore contrast and readability; WYSIWYG background color controls are disabled in dark mode to avoid unreadable combinations.
- Fixed: A case where Backspace on an empty input could bubble up and close the dialog; Backspace at the start of text inputs/textareas is now intercepted so focus safely remains in the field.

## Update v0.5.6
- Added: Official "Typecho Post Manager" extension that uses XML-RPC to fetch posts from Typecho, filter by date/category, and download them as local Markdown files, and it is now listed in the built-in extension marketplace.
- Added: Typecho Manager now supports creating and publishing posts directly from flyMD, editing slug/cover/custom fields, and lazily loading categories from the remote site on first publish to reduce manual configuration.
- Added: New `context.htmlToMarkdown` API for extensions, allowing plugins to convert HTML returned by Typecho, WordPress or arbitrary web APIs into Markdown with optional `baseUrl` to resolve relative links.
- Added: Built-in free Gemini Vision model in the AI Assistant so you can choose "Gemini Vision" under the free provider, with a dedicated "Bohe Gongyi" badge and link when that channel is used.
- Improved: Typecho Manager now supports keyword search, bulk download of selected posts, and smarter default download directories (relative or absolute), and automatically refreshes the file tree after pulling articles so your library view stays in sync with disk.
- Added: Advanced Typecho management tools including related-post suggestions based on the current document, per-blog statistics/health checks, and safe remote snapshots with rollback history so you can restore previous versions if a publish overwrites server content.
- Improved: Front Matter handling when downloading or publishing Typecho posts, preserving excerpt/cover/custom_* fields in YAML and writing them back after publish so local Markdown stays aligned with remote metadata.
- Added: Auto-hide scrollbars across editor, preview and library with hover-to-show behavior, plus a compact Front Matter summary bar at the top of Reading mode (title, categories, tags, status, slug/ID, date, source) with a toggle to show or hide it.
- Improved: Error handling for free models — when you hit rate limits or the daily free quota, the assistant now shows clear messages with the reason and suggested wait time instead of blindly retrying 429 responses.
- Improved: Applied a 1MB size limit to local images used in Vision mode and paste; oversized images are skipped with explicit warnings to avoid overloading requests, and fixed AI plugin docking so hidden windows no longer keep squeezing the editor area.
- Improved: Outline panel can be detached from the library into its own column, letting you switch between "Library | Outline | Editor" and "Library | Editor | Outline" layouts; when a plugin window docks on the right, the outline automatically shifts left, alongside visual polish to the library/sidebar, scrollbars, status bar and a Linux fix that forces an opaque background to avoid transparent/blank windows on Arch-like distributions.
- Fixed: Installed local fonts are now re-registered on launch so font selections like "Local: XXX" continue to work correctly after upgrading or restarting.

## Update v0.5.5
- Added: AI vision capabilities that let the assistant directly read local images and call vision models for understanding and analysis, including a time-limited free vision model to make it easier to try.
- Added: New window layout APIs for the extension system, enabling a three-column layout ("library sidebar + AI panel on the left + editor") and dynamic plugin positioning so right-docked and bottom-docked plugin panes avoid overlapping each other.
- Added: Exposed a YAML Front Matter and parsed metadata API so plugins can read the document front matter in a unified way, useful for blog publishing, library enhancements, and external app sync.
- Added: Published the third-party "Telegraph-Image" image hosting plugin in the extension marketplace so you can upload images to Telegraph in one click and get back shareable links.
- Improved: Layout behavior of AI plugin windows and bottom plugin panes in WYSIWYG mode so they no longer cover the tab bar and correctly push the editor area instead of overlapping it.
- Improved: Error handling around local and hosted images with size/limit prompts and fallback strategies, and fixed cases where images in dialogs or source mode could not be recognized by the AI.
- Fixed: Library sidebar drag-and-drop sorting now persists correctly, and several CORS-related issues and other edge cases have been resolved for a more stable overall experience.

## Update v0.5.4
- Added: AI chat can now link with Sticky Notes so you can quickly turn replies into notes or todos and keep ideas from getting lost.
- Improved: Default Sticky Note spawn position so new notes appear closer to the current document and area of focus, reducing manual dragging.
- Added: Custom drag-and-drop ordering for the sidebar tree so you can arrange documents in whatever order best matches your workflow.
- Improved: PDFs are now sorted separately from Markdown files in the library while still honoring your custom sort order, and deprecated custom library icons have been removed.
- Improved: PDF items are now distinguished by text color instead of a red dot, making the file list cleaner and less visually noisy.
- Improved: WebDAV sync defaults — newly created libraries start with WebDAV sync disabled to avoid accidentally syncing into an old library; once a sync path is configured, the setting follows library switching.
- Fixed: Added an explicit prompt when WebDAV is not configured and fixed a bug where the sync conflict dialog might fail to appear, reducing the risk of silent conflicts.
- Docs: Updated README and corrected the PackyCode link formatting.

## Update v0.5.3
- Added: Extension marketplace search for extension name, author, and description, plus GitHub / Official channel switching, an "installed only" filter, and a "Featured" badge with clearer card layout and loading states.
- Added: "Markdown Table Helper" marketplace extension that lets you quickly insert Markdown tables at the cursor, working together with WYSIWYG mode for a more spreadsheet-like editing experience.
- Improved: Unified table styling across Edit / Reading / WYSIWYG modes with light/dark-aware table color variables for borders and headers, boosting contrast and readability on dark backgrounds.
- Improved: Theme settings panel with new typography presets ("Tech", "Literary"), a new "Minimalist" Markdown style, and additional eye-friendly palettes (Tea Green, Paper White, Soft Pink), plus a tighter overall layout.
- Improved: Extension manager now uses incremental updates and background refresh of marketplace data when reopening the panel, avoiding full re-renders while still allowing a manual "Refresh" to force updates.
- Fixed: Visual inconsistencies in table borders/header colors under dark mode and some themes, and several styling issues in the extension manager when using dark themes.

## Update v0.5.2
- Added: Switched collaboration mode to a JS-driven custom cursor with clearer color differentiation, aligned cursor colors in the collaboration plugin, and bundled an official collaboration server option to make multi-user sessions easier to recognize and join.
- Improved: Refined WYSIWYG editing styles for KaTeX and other inline math, together with a cleaner baseline layout for the plain Edit mode so long-form editing and reading feel more consistent.
- Fixed: A series of WYSIWYG issues where Mermaid/Math NodeViews were constantly rebuilt (causing scrolling glitches), duplicate scrollbars appeared, and the code-block copy button stopped working, greatly improving stability.
- Fixed: Missing syntax highlighting for code blocks in WYSIWYG, blank Mermaid diagrams, and failures when opening PDFs from that mode, covering several rendering/export edge cases.
- Improved: Sticky Note mode styling and layout, including automatic height adjustment based on content, and fixed layout glitches that could appear when launching sticky notes from WYSIWYG mode.
- Added: New "Generate tag" and "Open in new instance" entries to the sidebar tree context menu to speed up multi-library and multi-window workflows.
- Fixed: Reading mode sometimes falling back to a pure white background under certain themes, and introduced a compatibility tweak for Arch Linux AppImage builds affected by WebKitGTK / GPU driver interactions that could cause white-screen issues.

## Update v0.5.1
- Added: Open collaborative editing support with an open-source FlyMD collaboration server sample (the `OSserver` directory) and the companion "Collaboration (Open Server)" extension, enabling room + password based multi-user editing on your own server (Beta).
- Added: Plugin host APIs for registering/consuming custom namespaces and listening to source-editor selection changes, providing the foundation for collaboration and other advanced extensions.
- Improved: File-tree click/double-click integration with the multi-tab system to avoid tab mix-ups or overwritten content when using Ctrl+click or switching libraries.
- Improved: Editor layout sizing and scrolling logic, fixing cases where repeated Enter presses could push the menubar/tabbar off-screen and where edit/preview area heights were miscalculated.
- Fixed: Layout glitches where using `Ctrl+Shift+V` to paste long "plain text" could make the menubar/tabbar disappear or become inconsistent.

## Update v0.5.0
- Added: Sticky Note mode to open the current document in a compact, dedicated note window that automatically switches to Focus + Reading mode, hides the sidebar, and keeps only the content area—ideal for todos, small reference notes, and ideas that should stay on the desktop.
- Added: Sticky Note controls with round "Lock position" and "Always on top" buttons, so you can disable window dragging to avoid accidental moves and keep notes floating above other apps.
- Added: Enhanced tab right-click menu with "Open in new instance", direct file rename on disk, and one-click "Create sticky note" from the current tab.
- Added: Sticky Note mode now supports quick todo input—type a line, press Enter or blur the field to jump back to Reading mode, and completed items get automatic strikethrough so notes work better as a lightweight todo board.
- Added: Integrated "Push" and "Remind" buttons into Sticky Note headers to send notes directly into the xxtui todo list and schedule reminders; new host APIs for the xxtui todo-push plugin and AI Assistant enable right-click actions "Generate todo" and "Generate & create reminder" that turn selected text into structured tasks.
- Improved: AI Assistant replies now support Markdown rendering and code highlighting, making long answers and code snippets much easier to read.
- Improved: AI requests gain automatic retry with a clearer "thinking…" indicator, while long-running operations like translation use a persistent, dismissible notification bar instead of transient toasts.
- Improved: Reworked the editor undo/redo logic with per-tab undo stacks so switching tabs or WYSIWYG modes no longer corrupts or mixes up your undo history.
- Fixed: Some extensions' long-running notifications either failed to stay visible or could not be dismissed correctly when using the unified notification API, and several scrolling/offset glitches in WYSIWYG mode plus code-copy button positioning in long documents.

## Update v0.4.8
- Added: WebDAV sync now supports end-to-end encryption, encrypting file contents locally before upload so even compromised servers cannot easily read the plaintext.
- Added: Restored the OMG preset endpoint and signup link in the AI Assistant settings for quick access to the OMG resource bundle.
- Added: More theme background options and Markdown layout presets, together with a refreshed layout for the theme settings panel.
- Fixed: WYSIWYG bold/italic shortcuts sometimes leaving the caret in the wrong position.
- Fixed: WYSIWYG code-block copy button becoming misaligned when used inside long code blocks.
- Fixed: Tauri HTTP scope validation so legitimate HTTP/HTTPS requests are no longer blocked by overly strict rules.

## Update v0.4.7
- Added: Full configuration export/import so you can back up or migrate all FlyMD settings, extensions, and cache data in one shot.
- Added: Portable Mode to store config alongside the app root, making it easy to carry FlyMD on a USB drive.
- Added: Tab right-click menu so actions like closing or pinning a tab can be done directly on the tab bar (details will be iterated in later builds).
- Improved: Adjusted `Ctrl+N` behavior to better fit the multi-tab workflow so new files and new tabs behave more intuitively together.
- Improved: When all tabs are closed, FlyMD now returns to a blank document in edit mode instead of leaving you in a “no document” state.
- Improved: Unified the plugin notification system through a top notification center and exposed new `showNotification / hideNotification` APIs for extensions.
- Improved: In the AI Assistant extension, the “Continue / Polish / Correct” quick actions can now focus only on the selected text, making right-click workflows selection-aware.
- Added: Reserved keyboard shortcut `Alt+W` for closing the current tab .

## Update v0.4.6
- Added: Right-click context menu items now support drag-and-drop sorting with persistent storage, while built-in entries stay locked to prevent mistakes.
- Added: Exit prompts and WebDAV conflict/delete confirmations are replaced with custom three-button dialogs (Save / Discard / Cancel) so every choice is explicit.
- Improved: On launch the app reads the OS dark preference, automatically forces night mode when appropriate, and ships refreshed tab-bar polish for dark themes.
- Improved: The extension runtime exposes a static asset URL helper, letting the AI assistant bundle avatar/fallback resources so icons render even offline.
- Fixed: Switching tabs no longer falsely marks documents as dirty, so confirmation dialogs only appear when real edits exist.

## Update v0.4.5
- Added: WebDAV sync now exposes a HTTP host whitelist so plaintext sync only runs against explicitly trusted hosts/ports, blocking accidental connections to unknown nodes.
- Improved: The sync dialog gains inline whitelist rows with + / - controls and empty-state hints, always keeping at least one editable input for smoother configuration.
- Improved: WYSIWYG edits now trigger the outline refresh pipeline and code-copy buttons always emit Markdown fences with language info for cleaner paste results.
- Fixed: Reworked the WYSIWYG `Ctrl+B / Ctrl+I` shortcuts to wrap selections directly in the Markdown source so the commands keep working even after focus hiccups.
- Improved: Save operations broadcast to the tab system, which instantly refreshes tab paths and clears the dirty asterisk after Save / Save As flows.
- Improved: Tauri request security is refactored to isolate the default HTTP scope into a dedicated `http:allow-fetch` role, limiting network access to declared URLs.

## Update v0.4.3
- Improved: macOS build upgraded to Universal Binary—single installer supports both Intel and Apple Silicon with native performance for each architecture
- Improved: Resolved build failure caused by GitHub Actions deprecating macos-13 runner
- Improved: Simplified macOS release process—users no longer need to distinguish between Intel and ARM versions

- Improved: AI chats can create todos and reminders directly in the thread while document-context actions stay in the right-click menu workflow
- Fixed: Restored Delete key text editing instead of deleting files, refreshed outline updates in Edit mode, let inline code exit correctly in WYSIWYG, and resolved sporadic top-bar occlusion to stay compatible with prior releases
- Fixed: WebDAV sync skipping file updates in certain scenarios

## Update v0.4.1
- Improved: Library sidebar open/close state is now persisted and restored across restarts and mode switches; first open automatically refreshes the tree to prevent empty panels
- Fixed: Focus Mode no longer hides the folder toggle arrows, so the library tree remains expandable even when WYSIWYG/Focus Mode is active

- Improved: AI dialog window now includes boundary checks to ensure at least 100px remains visible when dragging, preventing window loss
- Improved: Optimized extension settings window display logic, fixed issue where settings dialog wouldn't appear after AI window was closed
- Improved: WebDAV sync logs now use local timestamps for better readability; logs auto-truncate when exceeding 5MB to prevent unbounded growth
- Improved: Library sidebar now includes a “Switch Side” button to dock the library on the left or right; Focus Mode window controls automatically swap sides to avoid overlaps
- Improved: Library tree remembers folder expansion states per library, so your last browsing context is restored after restart
