# Roadmap

[简体中文](ROADMAP.md) | [English](ROADMAP.en.md)

## Update v0.5.1
- Added: Open collaborative editing support with an open-source FlyMD collaboration server sample (the `OSserver` directory) and the companion "Collaboration (Open Server)" extension, enabling room + password based multi-user editing on your own server (Beta).
- Added: Plugin host APIs for registering/consuming custom namespaces and listening to source-editor selection changes, providing the foundation for collaboration and other advanced extensions.
- Improved: File-tree click/double-click integration with the multi-tab system to avoid tab mix-ups or overwritten content when using Ctrl+click or switching libraries.
- Improved: Editor layout sizing and scrolling logic, fixing cases where repeated Enter presses could push the menubar/tabbar off-screen and where edit/preview area heights were miscalculated.
- Fixed: Layout glitches where using `Ctrl+Shift+V` to paste long "plain text" could make the menubar/tabbar disappear or become inconsistent.

## Update v0.5.0
- Added: Sticky Note mode to open the current document in a compact, dedicated note window that automatically switches to Focus + Reading mode, hides the sidebar, and keeps only the content area—ideal for todos, small reference notes, and ideas that should stay on the desktop.
- Added: Sticky Note controls with round "Lock position" and "Always on top" buttons, so you can disable window dragging to avoid accidental moves and keep notes floating above other apps.
- Added: Enhanced tab right-click menu with "Open in new instance", direct file rename on disk, and one-click "Create sticky note" from the current tab.
- Added: Sticky Note mode now supports quick todo input—type a line, press Enter or blur the field to jump back to Reading mode, and completed items get automatic strikethrough so notes work better as a lightweight todo board.
- Added: Integrated "Push" and "Remind" buttons into Sticky Note headers to send notes directly into the xxtui todo list and schedule reminders; new host APIs for the xxtui todo-push plugin and AI Assistant enable right-click actions "Generate todo" and "Generate & create reminder" that turn selected text into structured tasks.
- Improved: AI Assistant replies now support Markdown rendering and code highlighting, making long answers and code snippets much easier to read.
- Improved: AI requests gain automatic retry with a clearer "thinking…" indicator, while long-running operations like translation use a persistent, dismissible notification bar instead of transient toasts.
- Improved: Reworked the editor undo/redo logic with per-tab undo stacks so switching tabs or WYSIWYG modes no longer corrupts or mixes up your undo history.
- Fixed: Some extensions' long-running notifications either failed to stay visible or could not be dismissed correctly when using the unified notification API, and several scrolling/offset glitches in WYSIWYG mode plus code-copy button positioning in long documents.

## Update v0.4.8
- Added: WebDAV sync now supports end-to-end encryption, encrypting file contents locally before upload so even compromised servers cannot easily read the plaintext.
- Added: Restored the OMG preset endpoint and signup link in the AI Assistant settings for quick access to the OMG resource bundle.
- Added: More theme background options and Markdown layout presets, together with a refreshed layout for the theme settings panel.
- Fixed: WYSIWYG bold/italic shortcuts sometimes leaving the caret in the wrong position.
- Fixed: WYSIWYG code-block copy button becoming misaligned when used inside long code blocks.
- Fixed: Tauri HTTP scope validation so legitimate HTTP/HTTPS requests are no longer blocked by overly strict rules.

## Update v0.4.7
- Added: Full configuration export/import so you can back up or migrate all FlyMD settings, extensions, and cache data in one shot.
- Added: Portable Mode to store config alongside the app root, making it easy to carry FlyMD on a USB drive.
- Added: Tab right-click menu so actions like closing or pinning a tab can be done directly on the tab bar (details will be iterated in later builds).
- Improved: Adjusted `Ctrl+N` behavior to better fit the multi-tab workflow so new files and new tabs behave more intuitively together.
- Improved: When all tabs are closed, FlyMD now returns to a blank document in edit mode instead of leaving you in a “no document” state.
- Improved: Unified the plugin notification system through a top notification center and exposed new `showNotification / hideNotification` APIs for extensions.
- Improved: In the AI Assistant extension, the “Continue / Polish / Correct” quick actions can now focus only on the selected text, making right-click workflows selection-aware.
- Added: Reserved keyboard shortcut `Alt+W` for closing the current tab .

## Update v0.4.6
- Added: Right-click context menu items now support drag-and-drop sorting with persistent storage, while built-in entries stay locked to prevent mistakes.
- Added: Exit prompts and WebDAV conflict/delete confirmations are replaced with custom three-button dialogs (Save / Discard / Cancel) so every choice is explicit.
- Improved: On launch the app reads the OS dark preference, automatically forces night mode when appropriate, and ships refreshed tab-bar polish for dark themes.
- Improved: The extension runtime exposes a static asset URL helper, letting the AI assistant bundle avatar/fallback resources so icons render even offline.
- Fixed: Switching tabs no longer falsely marks documents as dirty, so confirmation dialogs only appear when real edits exist.

## Update v0.4.5
- Added: WebDAV sync now exposes a HTTP host whitelist so plaintext sync only runs against explicitly trusted hosts/ports, blocking accidental connections to unknown nodes.
- Improved: The sync dialog gains inline whitelist rows with + / - controls and empty-state hints, always keeping at least one editable input for smoother configuration.
- Improved: WYSIWYG edits now trigger the outline refresh pipeline and code-copy buttons always emit Markdown fences with language info for cleaner paste results.
- Fixed: Reworked the WYSIWYG `Ctrl+B / Ctrl+I` shortcuts to wrap selections directly in the Markdown source so the commands keep working even after focus hiccups.
- Improved: Save operations broadcast to the tab system, which instantly refreshes tab paths and clears the dirty asterisk after Save / Save As flows.
- Improved: Tauri request security is refactored to isolate the default HTTP scope into a dedicated `http:allow-fetch` role, limiting network access to declared URLs.

## Update v0.4.3
- Improved: macOS build upgraded to Universal Binary—single installer supports both Intel and Apple Silicon with native performance for each architecture
- Improved: Resolved build failure caused by GitHub Actions deprecating macos-13 runner

- Fixed: WebDAV sync skipping file updates in certain scenarios

## Update v0.4.1

- Added: A new "Translate" action translates the current selection (or the entire document) into fluent Chinese and inserts the result as quotes/sections.
- Added: Extension APIs expose `context.getPreviewElement` and `context.saveFileWithDialog`, enabling plugins to read the rendered preview DOM and open native save dialogs; the plugin guide includes matching examples.

- Added: Dropdown submenu API for extensions so plugins can build grouped menus and more complex action entries.
- Improved: Reworked the Edit mode padding and width control logic, aligning width tuning behavior between Edit and Reading modes so finding a comfortable reading width feels more natural.
- Fixed: Cleaning up extension-registered menus on uninstall to avoid stale or duplicated menu entries.

## Update v0.3.5
- Added: In Edit mode, pasting a URL with `Ctrl+V` now fetches the page `<title>` and expands it into a `[page title](https://...)` Markdown link, while `Ctrl+Shift+V` always pastes plain text.
- Fixed: When pasting from HTML sources, the editor no longer inserts both raw text and converted Markdown; `Ctrl+V` now only keeps the converted Markdown content.

## Update v0.3.2
- Fixed: PDF outline/bookmarks could become invalid; now exported and viewed PDFs retain correct table-of-contents navigation
- Improved: After WebDAV sync completes, the document library tree is proactively refreshed so you don't need to refresh manually
